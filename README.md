# **Sentiment Analysis for Customer Feedback**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates how to analyze customer feedback to classify sentiments as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The analysis is performed using machine learning and deep learning models, with results visualized for actionable insights.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is `customer_feedback.csv`, which contains the following columns:

- **feedback**: The text of the customer feedback.
- **sentiment**: The sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral).

### Example Data:
| feedback                             | sentiment  |
|--------------------------------------|------------|
| "The service was excellent!"         | positive   |
| "I am disappointed with the product" | negative   |
| "The delivery was okay."             | neutral    |

**Download**: You can find similar datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

## **Features**
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM) and deep learning models (LSTM).
- **Visualization**: Insights such as word clouds and sentiment distribution.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Sentiment prediction for new customer feedback.

## **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory (e.g., `data/customer_feedback.csv`).

4. Run the scripts or Jupyter notebooks.

## **How to Run**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
Clean and preprocess the dataset:
```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

### **2. Train the Sentiment Model**
Train a machine learning or deep learning model:
```bash
python src/sentiment_model.py
```

### **3. Predict Sentiment**
Use the trained model to predict sentiment for new feedback:
```bash
python src/predict_sentiment.py --text "I love this product!"
```

## **Visualization**
Generated visualizations include:
1. **Word Cloud**: Frequently used words in positive, negative, and neutral feedback.
2. **Sentiment Distribution**: Bar chart of sentiment counts.

### Example Visualization:

## **Future Improvements**
- Implement advanced models like **BERT** for better sentiment classification.
- Add support for multi-language sentiment analysis.
- Deploy the model as a REST API using **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
